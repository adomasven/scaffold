Relatively important
 - Fix error selection in code
 - Provide guidance on translator options
 - Links to documentation (why not?)
 - Translator testing
 - JS(H|L)int, comes nearly free with ACE
 - search within translator code
 - show matching translators for given page (import)
 - tools for writing export and search translators

Not very important
 - Automatic gisting? Or maybe something like Frank's style test generator? 
 - Type-to-find in translator load window
