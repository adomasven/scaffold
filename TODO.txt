A TODO list for the Scaffold code base


A few items that should probably be fixed:

- The two horizontal boxes should be of equal width 
  initially, and their height should adjust in parallel.

- If possible, error feedback should show up in the
  window when there is a syntax error in the translator
  JS code.  At the moment, it just issues no output.

- It would be nice if the selected translator could
  be made persistent.  It's a little annoying in 
  development to have to keep re-selecting the thing 
  after reach restart.
